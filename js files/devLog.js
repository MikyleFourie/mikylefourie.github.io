      'However, I took great interest in the readings for the week. I found that the main connective tissue between the two was about the overwhelming amount of knowledge in our present day. Bush mainly spoke about how we\'ve reached a space as a society where our accumulation of research and knowledge is so vast that we are hitting "a wall" on ways to store and access such knowledge (Bush, 1979). He muses on the possible future solutions we may come to. As a scientist and engineer, his thinking is very analytical and defined. He talks about the mechanics of why it is important for likeminded people to record and access knowledge, and the physical solutions we might have to achieve it. He proposed world where seemingly infinite information would be accessible to the layman, but ever the pragmatist, he also confirms that we would also have to comb through the information with our own discretion. Borges story of the Library of Babel is a fantasy of an infinite library of knowledge (Borges, 1998). Like all fantasy, it is rooted in reality. In this case, the same reality Bush spoke of. Borges addresses more of the metaphysical reality of "infinite information". The consequences of it. I particularly liked the bit where he spoke about librarians taking out a book that they deemed useless, but how the very act of it was useless as the infinite nature of the library meant there were always more books.',

While the syntax brings with it tedium, as pretty much all coding languages, I was really surprised at the intricacies of the Semantics of HTML. Because Twine projects are made to be experienced mostly in a confined space, the Semantics of how websites appear online and work with search engines was certainly something I didn't explore until now.

Where certain objects within the website may look visually identical, the back-end systems might perceive and handle them differently.

      'Reading: The reading "Convention and Context, Mailloux, 1983" (Mailloux, 1983) went about exploring defining the concept of convention. Initially I didn\'t understand the point, because I thought to myself "A convention is simply the way something is normally done", but as I read and thought further, I quickly ran into why defining convention more overtly is important. Convention is inherently linked to Context, which can be defined as the information surrounding the action that may limit what is considered "normal" and not. As such, the convention is then what is "normal" within a given context. In a similar sense, conventions contribute to context by adding information to the context. All this being said. In the design sphere (whether that by Web design, engineering, etc), it is important to keep the above contexts in mind. The designer should keep context and convention in mind when designing to either utilise them to make a more pleasant experience for users, or willingly break them to create a fresh and nuanced experience.',
      'Reflection on lecture: The lecture was all about engaging with the topic of "interactivity", and what it means to interact with things. As a creator (of games, projects, etc) interactivity permeates throughout all I work on. The lecture helped me break down interaction into two main categories - Interaction where the user\'s input does not cause substantial meaningful change. An example of this may be scrolling. Where its true that the website is changing and is thus being interacted with, that change is a fairly simple procedure. - Interaction may also be "non-trivial" where the user\'s actions cause substantial meaningful change. This may be for example, clicking a link on a webpage that loads up a new page. This involves multiple backend systems to work correctly and can be context dependent. Games are built primarily off of this interaction. It\'s worth noting of course that "meaningful" is subjective, and each interaction in a piece of digital media should be inspected through this lens thoroughly.',

      "Development of my website: This week I found myself re-evaluating the purpose of my website and my old wireframes. The lectures on JavaScript helped enlighten me to an entire world of new possibilities or the website. In a way, it can be heard to imagine something you don't know is possible, but as I saw certain logic act in the lectures and exercises, I realised the more unique and appealing ways I can present the required information on my website. For instance, the first iteration of wireframes for my website had all the information just listed in a segmented long scroll. I know realise I should categorise my information better, in a more compact way, such as putting all the Dev Logs together in one place, an introduction in another etc. i anticipate the reflection to be a long piece of text, and so I'm considering a natural way for the user to return to the top of the reflection or go to other parts of the site easily and conveniently.

UI needs to clearly demonstrate what its Purpose is and give feedback on whether it or systemically adjacent elements have fulfilled their Purpose or not.

While my spacing looked “passable”, I wanted to find a way to dynamically change the spacing with the length and width of the screen. My solution came in two forms! Firstly, I found I could assign widths and heights using [X]vw and [X]vh, which scale the width and height of the container to a percentage X of the view's width and heights respectively. Secondly, I found I could alter the display parameter of containers from the default block to the more dynamic flex containers. The flex containers bring with them new and useful parameters such as “align-items” and “justify-contents”. I made the items in my Navigation bar display as inline-flex containers within and unordered list, this allowed me to space them equally and dynamically as the width of the screen changes.",

Although, I think that is actually a mark of excellent UI Design, the ability for the purpose and function of the element to be intuitively interpreted. In Game Design, we often aim to utilize users' intuition and worldly knowledge to “reduce cognitive load”. Here's an anecdotal example: Why should I spend extra resources (and ask the user to do the same) to tell them this potion is a Health Potion, when making it Red and putting a + symbol on it would 90% of the time immediately convey its purpose. Similarly, UI design should be Intuitive. For instance, I wanted to make a 'Scroll to top' button for my website (out of my skillset for now as I am not versed in JavaScript, but definitely still goal for the future); I believe the best symbol for such a button would be an up-arrow. Similarly, when my website becomes thin enough, the navigation bar changes form from a horizontal list at the top of the screen to a vertical one that ejects from the side of the screen when the 'burger' button is pressed. The 'burger' button is a standard icon used in most websites in the present day, so I believe it fair to trust users to understand what the button would do without having to label it in any way.",

      "Reflections on the readings: The main reading of the week was a “Towards a study of information geographies” (Mark Graham, 2015)”. This paper aimed to explore the idea that information is inherently affected by geography (and affects geography as well). This has been true throughout time but with the advent of the internet the effects are even more noticeable. There are 3 core geographic distributions explored, that of Access, Participation, and Representation. The paper reveals that the worlds use of the internet is still heavily in favour of the United States, the United Kingdom as well as Australia and China, as internet is cheaper and more accessible in these countries. Consequently, many of the information uploaded onto the internet also comes from these countries, meaning that many projects, narratives, and perspectives are coming from a few specific sources. We can see some troubling data that for countries like my own (South Africa), there is more content created about us internationally than locally, meaning there is a lack of authentic perspectives being represented. As internet access (and access to education) is increasing in South Africa, it is the responsibility of young developers to create more and bring the narrative back into our hands. Within the context of my own website for example, speaking more about the South African dev experience (in this log for example) is a small but meaningful contribution to the sphere of information on the internet. ",
      "Another reading this week (Andrea Ballatore, 2017)spoke on how Search Engines work to reduce or further exacerbate this inequality of information geographies. In theory, the internet and Web 2.0 should create a space where information from multiple different perspectives may all be displayed and perceived equally. However, Search Engines (much like social media) have proven to be somewhat of an echo chamber due to user-personalized experiences. The search engines ‘learn’ what users are interested in and filter accordingly to increase convenience for the users. Unfortunately, the by-product of this is that ones Search Engine results often reinforce one’s own biases and perspectives and willing push away conflicting information. Due to this people are becoming more adverse to engaging with differing opinions (at least on the internet).",
      "Reflections on my website: The first iteration of website is complete and submitted now, and the greatest learning experience for it was learning first-hand the truth of what my lecturer Andre had said: “You can sit for hours fine tuning your CSS and making little to no actual progress”. My initial wireframe and plan for my cite was rudimentary, which resulted in my development experience being mostly comprised of ‘on-the-fly’ learning. I spent many many hours treading the same ground as the knowledge was still solidifying and I had had no concrete plan. During the process I created a better wireframe with a clearer vision. And I aim to use the IxD process to help further clarify my goals for the site. I also could not figure out why my NavBar would not work so I aim to go back and fix that.",

      "This week we returned to some CSS in our lectures, mainly covering Overflow and Flexboxes. During my development process for the previous iteration, I had already learned plenty about flexboxes as I found myself too uncomfortable of the static nature of elements without them. I found placing and aligning objects to be much easier with Flexboxes. The Overflow property looks like exactly what I envisioned for my Devlog and Design sections of my website. In the current form of the design section, the images are shown in the centre of the screen and are followed by long paragraphs that the user must scroll trough to read. Both pages are very long and difficult to navigate. For the DevLog section I plan to allow users to read and scroll through an individual Devlog inside a box that fits snuggly in the centre of the screen. At the top of this box, I want to put a control that allows users to pick which Devlog they want to read (changed via JavaScript). By using overflow (and cropping the screen accordingly), this control panel will also stay on screen at all times. I think this would look neater than adding a second fixed bar underneath the current navbar or to the side. For the design section, using overflow I plan to place the images next to the paragraphs and allow users to scroll through the paragraph, thereby keeping the image in view.",
      "The theoretical content for this week was on Digital Inequalities, and I decided to do a reading of (Lutz, 2019). The article posits that digital divides mirror social inequalities, and seeks to explore multiple levels of digital divides, especially in regard to emerging technologies like AI (which has become a very pertinent topic over the past few weeks). The first level of digital divide is that of ‘access’. There are many people who cannot access the internet due to economic and infrastructural circumstances. This is a reality I’ve seen and experienced in my country; more people have access to mobile devices than physical. The ramifications of this seemed straightforward to me at first, but the article brought my attention to the fact that certain content is inaccessible to those on mobile, and that the space for creation on mobile devices is far more constricted than that of desktops. The second level of digital divide focuses on a divide in skills and usage. That is, even though we may have overcome infrastructural limitations in some communities there is still cultural and skill-based issues preventing certain groups of people from engaging with and creating on the internet. The third level of digital divide is best summarised as “gaps in individuals’ capacity to translate their internet access and use into favourable offline outcomes”. In this case, people have physical access to the internet, and are learning how to use it directly, but there is still an inequality regarding how they can capitalise on their use to build new opportunities. Internet culture (and STEM as a whole) has a history of being more appealing and accessible to Cis- white males. As more minorities are coming into the world of the internet, we still see a divide in who are creating sustainable businesses on the internet. I believe this divide is reflective of a divide in experience in using the internet.",

      "JavaScripts main benefit is that it allows websites to become more interactive. Because of this, I decided to see how I could use JavaScript to help supplement weaker parts of my website based on feedback from my first submission. My DevLog Section and my Design section were previously both long single pages where the user had to scroll through them. For the DevLog Section, I fixed this by storing all my Logs and their complementary References as an array in the Back-End, and dynamically displaying one Log at a time in the Front-End. The user can traverse through the logs one-by-one using forward and backward buttons. I also found that saving paragraphs as an array (that is, there is an array of logs made up of two sub-arrays: one for paragraphs and one for references) allowed me to format them nicely when they are inserted into the innerHTML of the p-tag using the .join() function, joining the paragraphs with breaks between them. An unexpected step of the process in making this dynamic log system work was the need to add and clear the children of the Reference List (the individual list items). I accomplished this via DOM manipulation, where I appended and removed children (in the form of list items) to the list itself.",
      "The theoretical component of the course this week was on the Decolonisation of Technology. I’ll admit that I found it difficult to wrap my head around the concept at first. Even after watching the pre-recorded lecture, I found myself struggling to understand how Computers and Technology were colonised in the first place, as I’ve always prescribed to the thought that they – like other sciences - were ‘objective truths’. After attending an in-person lecture and engaging with the reading (Abeba Birhane, 2020) I found myself awaking to the fact that the culture and language ingrained within the field of technology is indeed colonialised and HEAVILY favours that of Cis- white males. My lecturer used an anecdotal example to explain that the language and the way we engage with technology as a whole is largely based on perspective and background, and the current form of colonialised technology discounts all perspectives outside of the European or American norm. This week has confirmed a feeling regarding the field of computers and technologies I’ve had but failed to put into words: that the history and heritage of the field has promoted a conservative culture that discredit people of colour and women. This discreditation comes from misinformed perspectives on physiognomy and eugenics. I believe lectures, papers, and discussions on the topic of decolonisation is the greatest step we can take towards progressing towards it.",

I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHY MY NAVBAR WAS NOT STICKING TO THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. So, I had been having many struggles with this previously; a simple google or StackOverflow question will tell you all you need to do is set the position property of the nav to ‘fixed’. I had done that, YET IT WAS STILL NOT FIXED. So, after digging and digging, removing many lines of code, and adding many more, I finally figured it out. It was the blur filter on my background… FOR SOME REASON (of which I am still not sure), the blur filter broke the ability for the nav to stay affixed to the top of the screen. When faced with having to choose one: a blurred filter, or a fully functioning Navbar, the decision was simple. While I was fiddling with the NavBar I also implemented a burger button that worked via JS EventListers (instead of a HTML form check as before). I also added an animation for the mobile version of the Navbar, which collapses out of the side. Making the mobile NavBar collapse in-and-out from the side o the screen involved adding and removing additional classes on the NavBar using DOM manipulation which was a fun challenge.",

Is this because women and POC are consciously pushed away from the field? No, I don’t think so. Rather, I think its more likely that white males are exposed to and encouraged to explore the field more from a younger age and thus there are more people from this group who grow up to pursue it. The RAPUNSEL project aimed to create a space for young girls to become comfortable with computer science through a game where they can socialise, have fun, and express themselves. I think this is a beautiful way of helping equalise the gender divide in the field early on.",

I searched up some API’s on Google but struggled to find any that felt relevant for such a website. I eventually decided to check the Mozilla documentation in an effort to find an API that interested me. I then found Speech Synthesis, an API that reads out sections of text. I thought this would be perfect to implement to the devlogs and maybe essay sections of my site, as they are very long sections of text. Exploring this API was quite fun, as I had discovered browsers have built in Voice packs (or arrays), which I could use. It sounds very funny to listen to my devlogs being read out in a French accent. Once I was done playing around with it and getting familiar with the pieces of it, I tried implementing it into my Devlogs section and had trouble. The first issue I ran into was the fact that the array of voices was not saving correctly. I struggled with this for a while, before finding the cause on Stack Overflow, namely, the lines of code that saved the voices as an array would run before the browser would load the voices. Similarly, an issue arose when I tried to make the voice play when a button was pressed. This was an issue because the I would have to retrieve the devlog text being displayed, which would change dynamically. This led me down a rabbit hole where I had to learn to use Javascripts Time Out and Interval functions. Using these, I could play the voice 50 milliseconds after the button is pressed, giving the browser enough time to load the voices and retrieve the correct text.",
