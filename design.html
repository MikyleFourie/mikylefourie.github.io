      <h1>Wireframes</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Initial wireframe</h2>
        <img src="images/initialWireframe.png" class="wireframe" />
        <p>
          Above we can the initial wireframe I made when first trying to
          conceptualize my website. Honestly, at the time I was very confused on
          what we were being tasked to make. I also lacked the knowledge to make
          anything in HTML/CSS which made coming up with ideas difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at it now, with hindsight in my toolkit, its funny to see how
          similar each of the three pages are (also funny that there are only
          three). Looking at it now, I can almost - in my mind - draw various
          boxes for sections, divs and p's. In that way, I wasn't totally on the
          wrong track, although I certainly had put no thought into a better
          user experience or the 'flow' through the site.
        </p>
        <h2>Second wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          A key evolution for my second wireframe was the idea that the site
          should proabably have a 'thin' and 'wide' version for desktop and
          mobile use respectively. Lets look at each page:
        </p>
        <h3>New Homepage:</h3>
        <img src="images/newHome.png" class="wireframe" />
        <p>
          Here we can see me flesh out the concept of the Navigation Bar. It was
          at this point that I clarified for myself that the NavBar needs to
          'stick'to the top of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also realised at this point, that if the screen were to be of
          varying widths, I would't want there to be huge empty space between
          the Left items (Logo and name) and Right Items(Page Links), and so I
          was inspired to look into flex containers. I also realised that if the
          screen got too thin, the items on the NavBar would either shrink or
          layer ontop of one another; both options I wasn't fond of. Using
          inspiration from other sites, I devised that the menu should collapse
          and be represented by a burger button on the right. When the button is
          clicked, a vertical representation of the navigation links should
          eject from the right side of the screen. (I tried getting it to eject
          from other directions as well, but coming from the left or bottom
          didnt feel intuitive, and the top was causing issues as it interacted
          with the NavBar).
        </p>
        <p>
          I've found that the Side ejected version of the NavBar sometimes
          pushes other objects down. This is something I aim to fix in the
          future.
        </p>
        <h3>New Developers Logs:</h3>
        <img src="images/newDevlog.png" class="wireframe" />
        <p>
          In this section we can see the plan I had for the Devlogs that I was
          unable to achieve with my limited understanding of JavaScript
          currently.
        </p>
        <p>
          To explain what I intend to do though: I don't want the users to have
          to scroll through all of the Devlogs, nor do I want them to click to
          separate pages to read each one as I recognise this isn't a pleasant
          user experience. Instead, I want the Devlogs to appear in the centre
          of the screen in a block that can scroll down through the text itself.
          I want there to be a Previous and Next button at the top of the block
          to allow users to intuitevely progress between the Devlogs (and
          because the Devlogs are chronological, I believe this will be
          intuitive). I will consider putting a horizontal list (or grid) of
          buttons below the box that allows users to skip to any entry in the
          devlogs for flexability. Being able to create blocks of text that can
          independently scroll and change text is my most anticipated goal for
          the project.
        </p>
        <h3>New Design Section:</h3>
        <img src="images/newDesign.png" class="wireframe" />
        <p>
          Here we see I had a similar intention for the Design section as the
          devlogs. Namely to have comparison pictures of the old and new
          wireframes that stay on screen as you scroll through the text entry
          describing them. The page in its current form was the best I could
          achieve at present.
        </p>
        <h3>New Style Guide:</h3>
        <img src="images/newStyleGuide.png" class="wireframe" />
        <p>
          The Style Guide is to appear in the Design Section, underneath the
          wireframes. I planned for it to be appear as a numbered Key on the
          left side with descriptions on the right
        </p>
        <h3>IxD Analysis</h3>
        <img src="images/newIxD.png" class="wireframe" />
        <p>
          This section is another that I could not implement due to its need to
          use JavaScript. I planned for a list of 'bubbles' (buttons) on the
          left, that when clicked change the text on the right to match.
        </p>
        <h3>Profile and Portfolio</h3>
        <img src="images/newPort.png" class="wireframe" />
        <p>
          This section is presently being displayed as I envisioned, albeit
          without some functionality. With each item in the portfolio being
          displayed as small thumbnails. Eventually, I'd like it if the user can
          click on each Thumbnail and be shown and expanded description of the
          game, be that on another page, or a new container on the same page
          (which would likely need some JavaScript).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Style Guide</h1>
        <h2>Goal Statement</h2>
        <p>
          I want my website to feel like a mixed between grounded and solid, as
          well as calm and light.
        </p>
        <h2>Colour Palette</h2>
        <div class="squarePic">
          <img src="images/colourPalette.png" id="clrPal" />
          <p>
            The colours to the left were chosen to contribute to the goal
            statement. The green and beige are earth tones, which contribute to
            feelings of groundedness (along with the background). The grey and
            maroon were chosen as they are complementary but also contrast in a
            convenient way to make certain things stand out.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Font Choice</h2>
        <div class="longPic">
          <img src="images/fontChoice.png" id="fontCh" />
          <p>
            Font is usually something you don't notice unless it's a
            particularly terrible choice. Choosing the font for my site
            basically involved me looking through a large list of fonts and
            picking a few I liked. Dosis ended up being my favourite. It's
            balance of straight edges and soft curves felt perfect for my sites
            balance of Stability and Calm.
