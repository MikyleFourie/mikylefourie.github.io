        <h1>Wireframes</h1>
        <h2>Initial wireframe</h2>
        <article class="BigPic">
          <img src="/images/initialWireframe.png" class="Wireframe" />
          <p>
            Above we can the initial wireframe I made when first trying to
            conceptualize my website. Honestly, at the time I was very confused
            on what we were being tasked to make. I also lacked the knowledge to
            make anything in HTML/CSS which made coming up with ideas difficult.
            <br />
            Looking at it now, with hindsight in my toolkit, its funny to see
            how similar each of the three pages are (also funny that there are
            only three). Looking at it now, I can almost - in my mind - draw
            various boxes for sections, divs and p's. In that way, I wasn't
            totally on the wrong track, although I certainly had put no thought
            into a better user experience or the 'flow' through the site.
          </p>
        </article>

        <h2>Second wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          A key evolution for my second wireframe was the idea that the site
          should proabably have a 'thin' and 'wide' version for desktop and
          mobile use respectively. Lets look at each page:

          <h3>New Homepage:</h3>
          <article class="SmallPic">
            <img src="/images/newHome.png" class="SmallWireframe" />
            <p>
              Here we can see me flesh out the concept of the Navigation Bar. It
              was at this point that I clarified for myself that the NavBar
              needs to 'stick' to the top of the screen.
              <br /><br />
              I also realised at this point, that if the screen were to be of
              varying widths, I would't want there to be huge empty space
              between the Left items (Logo and name) and Right Items(Page
              Links), and so I was inspired to look into flex containers. I also
              realised that if the screen got too thin, the items on the NavBar
              would either shrink or layer ontop of one another; both options I
              wasn't fond of. Using inspiration from other sites, I devised that
              the menu should collapse and be represented by a burger button on
              the right. When the button is clicked, a vertical representation
              of the navigation links should eject from the right side of the
              screen. (I tried getting it to eject from other directions as
              well, but coming from the left or bottom didnt feel intuitive, and
              the top was causing issues as it interacted with the NavBar).
              <br /><br />
              I've found that the Side ejected version of the NavBar sometimes
              pushes other objects down. This is something I aim to fix in the
              future.
              <br /><br />
              Its been a few weeks since the above paragraphs, and I've managed
              to fix the NavBar. In it's current the side-NavBar ejects from the
              right with some pleasing animations implemented via JavaScript,
              once the burger button is click. The menu items also dynamically
              change colour depending on which page the user is currently on.
              <br /><br />
              The home page is looking a bit bland however. For the next
              iteration of the site I plan to implement an API to spice it up a
              little.

          <h3>New Developers Logs:</h3>
          <article class="SmallPic">
            <p>
              In this section we can see the plan I had for the Devlogs that I
              was unable to achieve with my limited understanding of JavaScript
              currently.
              <br /><br />
              To explain what I intend to do though: I don't want the users to
              have to scroll through all of the Devlogs, nor do I want them to
              click to separate pages to read each one as I recognise this isn't
              a pleasant user experience. Instead, I want the Devlogs to appear
              in the centre of the screen in a block that can scroll down
              through the text itself. I want there to be a Previous and Next
              button at the top of the block to allow users to intuitevely
              progress between the Devlogs (and because the Devlogs are
              chronological, I believe this will be intuitive). I will consider
              putting a horizontal list (or grid) of buttons below the box that
              allows users to skip to any entry in the devlogs for flexability.
              Being able to create blocks of text that can independently scroll
              and change text is my most anticipated goal for the project.

              <br /><br />
              Its been a few weeks, and I've managed to implement the above
              almost exactly as envisioned with the use of JavaScript. The left
              and right buttons also turn off accordingly when the user is at
              the beggining or end of the list.

          <h3>New Design Section:</h3>
          <article class="SmallPic">
            <img src="/images/newDesign.png" class="SmallWireframe" />
            <p>
              Here we see I had a similar intention for the Design section as
              the devlogs. Namely to have comparison pictures of the old and new
              wireframes that stay on screen as you scroll through the text
              entry describing them. The page in its current form was the best I
              could achieve at present (the "current form" mentioned here was a
              long static page).
              <br /><br />
              Its been a few weeks and I've managed to create the Design page I
              had envisioned. In its current form the text overlaps and allows
              users to scroll while keeping the images in focus; this took a lot
              of trial and error with multiple CSS classes.
              <br />
              The page is still pretty long however, so I implemented a buttom
              that returns the users to the top of the screen with a sinle
              press.
              <br /><br />
              I also decided to move the IxD and Style guides onto 'different
              pages'. Or rather, now users can toggle what information appears
              on this screen via the use of the buttons at the top of the
              screen.
              <br />
              <br />
              The pictures here are still unfortunately not vertically centered
              with the adjacent paragraphs. This is something I aim to fix in
              future.

          <h3>New Style Guide:</h3>
          <article class="SmallPic">
            <p>
              The Style Guide is to appear in the Design Section, underneath the
              wireframes. I planned for it to be appear as a numbered Key on the
              left side with descriptions on the right
              <br /><br />
              The guide no longer appears at the bottom of the design page under
              the Design Section itself but is now instead toggleable via the
              use of the buttons at the top of the screen.

            <p>
              This section is another that I could not implement due to its need
              to use JavaScript. I planned for a list of 'bubbles' (buttons) on
              the left, that when clicked change the text on the right to match.
              <br /><br />
              I managed to implement it, but unfortunately it still isn't
              exactly how I envisioned. I'll be asking my lecturers and firends
              who visit my website if they think the Design Section and IxD
              Section are too long to scroll through, and maybe use the idea
              here on the left as inspiration for how I may make these pages
              more compact. I anticipate it'll reult in quite a bit of work with
              the CSS and JavaScript.

            <p>
              This section is presently being displayed as I envisioned, albeit
              without some functionality. With each item in the portfolio being
              displayed as small thumbnails. Eventually, I'd like it if the user
              can click on each Thumbnail and be shown and expanded description
              of the game, be that on another page, or a new container on the
              same page (which would likely need some JavaScript).
              <br /><br />
              This page had been mostly untouched for the second iteration of
              the site unfortunately due to scope and crunch. The next iteration
              after this is our final Exam submission. For that one, I'd like to
              really nail down the Portfolio page and maybe implement the Git
              API.
