            However, I took great interest in the readings for the week. I found
            that the main connective tissue between the two was about the
            overwhelming amount of knowledge in our present day. Bush mainly
            spoke about how we've reached a space as a society where our
            accumulation of research and knowledge is so vast that we are
            hitting "a wall" on ways to store and access such knowledge (Bush,
            1979). He muses on the possible future solutions we may come to. As
            a scientist and engineer, his thinking is very analytical and
            defined. He talks about the mechanics of why it is important for
            likeminded people to record and access knowledge, and the physical
            solutions we might have to achieve it. He proposed world where
            seemingly infinite information would be accessible to the layman,
            but ever the pragmatist, he also confirms that we would also have to
            comb through the information with our own discretion. Borges story
            of the Library of Babel is a fantasy of an infinite library of
            knowledge (Borges, 1998). Like all fantasy, it is rooted in reality.
            In this case, the same reality Bush spoke of. Borges addresses more
            of the metaphysical reality of "infinite information". The
            consequences of it. I particularly liked the bit where he spoke
            about librarians taking out a book that they deemed useless, but how
            the very act of it was useless as the infinite nature of the library
            meant there were always more books.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think both pieces can be seen as allegories for the internet in
            some ways. While there is immense value in such a vast source of
            knowledge - that being for students around the world to access
            information faster and more conveniently than ever before -, the
            internet also carries with it some troubling issues, such as
            overstimulation and a psuedo-permanant record of everything one
            does.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anonymity on the internet has also made people with malicious
            intentions bolder, and less accountable. We're even seeing "Cancel
            Culture" on the internet mimic medieval Mob culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The internet grew at a staggering speed. Fast enough that we humans
            struggle to evolve to match it, physically, mentally, and even
            legislatively.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's pretty cool to find this course already pushing me to think
            about the environment of the internet as delicate. I feel as though
            more responsibility on the shoulders of web developers would help
            make the internet more inhabitable. I want to keep that in mind
            throughout this course.

            Starting HTML has been an interesting experience. Last year I played
            around with some CSS and HTML during a Twine workshop. But it has
            been a long time since then, so the experience this past week has
            been akin to shakily relearning how to ride a bike. While the syntax
            brings with it tedium, as pretty much all coding languages, I was
            really surprised at the intricacies of the Semantics of HTML.
            Because Twine projects are made to be experienced mostly in a
            confined space, the Semantics of how websites appear online and work
            with search engines was certainly something I didn't explore until
            now. The course has also clarified to me the divide between HTML and
            CSS, which I'm excited to jump into next week.
          </p>
          <p>
            The readings this week (Lawson, 2019) mainly dealt with why you
            should use certain divisions or containers in HTML, mainly in the
            context of promoting accessibility for individuals who use screen
            readers. I had never considered how a screen reader traverses and
            interprets a website, and now it is clear to me how a little extra
            work in the back-end HTML can be beneficial for users. I see that
            using HTML Sections helps screen readers narrate when a section
            begins and ends (although there are other ways to accomplish this).
            However, for most purposes, articles prove to be a superior choice.
            As I understand it, Articles are self-contained, making them
            convenient to use in syndication.
          </p>
          <p>
            This week we also covered a bit of the history of the internet. It's
            quite profound to think that the internet has grown at such a
            staggering pace. I know this is true of most technologies, but I
            suppose I'm just more intimately familiar with the internet as
            opposed to other technologies like... water-purification I suppose.
            I also find it interesting how the current NFT craze seems to be
            eerily similar to the Dotcom bubble.

            My experience in developing my website: I took great interest in
            this week's lessons in CSS, particularly the logical semantics of
            creating the website and how that contributes to how the website is
            presented and is "seen" by search engines and screen readers. Where
            certain objects within the website may look visually identical, the
            back-end systems might perceive and handle them differently. I've
            been enjoying experimenting with CSS in an effort to put my vision
            to the (web)page. The flexibility of CSS is simultaneously exciting
            and intimidating. Exciting because i could theoretically create
            precisely what I imagine; intimidating because the creation process
            could vary wildly and may require lots of trial and effort.

            Reading: The reading "Convention and Context, Mailloux, 1983"
            (Mailloux, 1983) went about exploring defining the concept of
            convention. Initially I didn't understand the point, because I
            thought to myself "A convention is simply the way something is
            normally done", but as I read and thought further, I quickly ran
            into why defining convention more overtly is important. Convention
            is inherently linked to Context, which can be defined as the
            information surrounding the action that may limit what is considered
            "normal" and not. As such, the convention is then what is "normal"
            within a given context. In a similar sense, conventions contribute
            to context by adding information to the context. All this being
            said. In the design sphere (whether that by Web design, engineering,
            etc), it is important to keep the above contexts in mind. The
            designer should keep context and convention in mind when designing
            to either utilise them to make a more pleasant experience for users,
            or willingly break them to create a fresh and nuanced experience.

            Reflection on lecture: The lecture was all about engaging with the
            topic of "interactivity", and what it means to interact with things.
            As a creator (of games, projects, etc) interactivity permeates
            throughout all I work on. The lecture helped me break down
            interaction into two main categories - Interaction where the user's
            input does not cause substantial meaningful change. An example of
            this may be scrolling. Where its true that the website is changing
            and is thus being interacted with, that change is a fairly simple
            procedure. - Interaction may also be "non-trivial" where the user's
            actions cause substantial meaningful change. This may be for
            example, clicking a link on a webpage that loads up a new page. This
            involves multiple backend systems to work correctly and can be
            context dependent. Games are built primarily off of this
            interaction. It's worth noting of course that "meaningful" is
            subjective, and each interaction in a piece of digital media should
            be inspected through this lens thoroughly.

            Development of my website: This week I found myself re-evaluating
            the purpose of my website and my old wireframes. The lectures on
            JavaScript helped enlighten me to an entire world of new
            possibilities or the website. In a way, it can be heard to imagine
            something you don't know is possible, but as I saw certain logic act
            in the lectures and exercises, I realised the more unique and
            appealing ways I can present the required information on my website.
            For instance, the first iteration of wireframes for my website had
            all the information just listed in a segmented long scroll. I know
            realise I should categorise my information better, in a more compact
            way, such as putting all the Dev Logs together in one place, an
            introduction in another etc. i anticipate the reflection to be a
            long piece of text, and so I'm considering a natural way for the
            user to return to the top of the reflection or go to other parts of
            the site easily and conveniently. After Hanli's lecture on UI I have
            a better eye to scrutinize the presentation and purpose of each of
            my UI elements. Next week I want to look at examples of people's
            self-made websites for inspiration.
          </p>
          <p>
            How does the UI relate to interactivity: This week we inspected UI
            closer, namely how it is the vessel of communication from the system
            when interaction takes place. On the one hand, each UI element is
            made up of a Signifier (what the user sees) and Signified (what the
            element does). UI needs to clearly demonstrate what its Purpose is
            and give feedback on whether it or systemically adjacent elements
            have fulfilled their Purpose or not. During this week I've become
            more aware of UI elements that I took for granted and didn't take
            much notice of previously, such as the Top Navigation bar of a
            website staying at the top as I scroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reflection on the readings: The reading "The Basic Principles of
            User Interface Design" (Studio, N/A) was clear and easy to learn
            from. I want to compare each of the principles to my own website
            regularly as a checklist of sorts, to ensure I'm hitting the mark. I
            really enjoyed the section that spoke about cognitive load. While it
            may not be something most of us think about consciously, we have
            probably all experienced a website/app where the UI was over
            stimulating in a way that slowed us down and hindered our experience
            with the systems. I've come to realise that websites should be
            intuitive to navigate as to allow users to spend brain resources
            elsewhere.

            I've spent a large part of this weeks development time on building
            my Navigation bar. Throughout this process, and due to the nature of
            some more “hands on tinkering”, I've definitely become more intimate
            with my understanding of CSS. Firstly, I've discovered I can “fix”
            the Navigation bar to the top of the screen (such that it stays
            there as the user scrolls), quite easily by changing the position
            parameter of the &lt;nav&gt; to fixed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this weeks practical CSS lecture with (my lecturer)
            Andre, there were moments were he would align objects precisely
            using margins and padding with pixel values. My mind immediately
            jumped to thought “would the spacing of objects not look odd in
            certain aspect ratio's?”, and I ran into such issues while building
            my Navigation bar. While my spacing looked “passable”, I wanted to
            find a way to dynamically change the spacing with the length and
            width of the screen. My solution came in two forms! Firstly, I found
            I could assign widths and heights using [X]vw and [X]vh, which scale
            the width and height of the container to a percentage X of the
            view's width and heights respectively. Secondly, I found I could
            alter the display parameter of containers from the default block to
            the more dynamic flex containers. The flex containers bring with
            them new and useful parameters such as “align-items” and
            “justify-contents”. I made the items in my Navigation bar display as
            inline-flex containers within and unordered list, this allowed me to
            space them equally and dynamically as the width of the screen
            changes.

            This week was largely spent on making sure the website looks
            appealing, both in general and for different screen sizes. One main
            design decision I made was: For wider screens (such as tablets and
            desktops), headings should lay on the top left of the screen; and
            for thinner screens, headings should be centered. I believe this to
            be a more pleasant reading 'flow' for users.
          </p>
          <p>
            I achieved this by using a media query that adjusts the properties
            of my containers when below a certain width. Fortunately for me, the
            Flex containers do much of the heavy lifting in this regard and
            allowed me to easily re-order and re-align the containers.

            While working on my devlog section I found that my plan on my
            wireframe is not very achievable without JavaScript as I wanted to
            use buttons to dynamically change text. While that version will be a
            goal for the next stage of this project, for now I had to scale it
            back to a more traditional block layout where the user can scroll
            through the entries. I found myself more intentionally thinking
            about the semantics of &lt;article&gt and &lt;section&gt. I was
            conscious about how the HTML was laid out, how it would be read by a
            screen reader and how I could repurpose blocks of code for each
            blogpost.

          <h3>Reflection on the lecture on Ethics of UX Practice:</h3>
          <p>
            UI and UX are aspects of technology that largely go under our noses.
            Although, I think that is actually a mark of excellent UI Design,
            the ability for the purpose and function of the element to be
            intuitively interpreted. In Game Design, we often aim to utilize
            users' intuition and worldly knowledge to “reduce cognitive load”.
            Here's an anecdotal example: Why should I spend extra resources (and
            ask the user to do the same) to tell them this potion is a Health
            Potion, when making it Red and putting a + symbol on it would 90% of
            the time immediately convey its purpose. Similarly, UI design should
            be Intuitive. For instance, I wanted to make a 'Scroll to top'
            button for my website (out of my skillset for now as I am not versed
            in JavaScript, but definitely still goal for the future); I believe
            the best symbol for such a button would be an up-arrow. Similarly,
            when my website becomes thin enough, the navigation bar changes form
            from a horizontal list at the top of the screen to a vertical one
            that ejects from the side of the screen when the 'burger' button is
            pressed. The 'burger' button is a standard icon used in most
            websites in the present day, so I believe it fair to trust users to
            understand what the button would do without having to label it in
            any way.
          </p>
          <h3>My IxD Process during development of my website:</h3>
          <p>
            The final version of my IxD Process is documented in the Design
            portion of this Website. However, here I will comment that I found
            the process to be greatly beneficial in helping visualise and align
            my goals. While it's still fairly rudimentary as my skills (and
            vision) are still limited, I'll certainly revisit this process and
            continue to iterate.
